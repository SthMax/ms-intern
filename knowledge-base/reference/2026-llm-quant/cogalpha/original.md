Abstract
Discovering effective predictive signals, or “al-
phas,” from financial data with high dimen-
sionality and extremely low signal-to-noise ra-
tio remains a difficult open problem. Despite
progress in deep learning, genetic program-
ming, and, more recently, large language model
(LLM)–based factor generation, existing ap-
proaches still explore only a narrow region of
the vast alpha search space. Neural models tend
to produce opaque and fragile patterns, while
symbolic or formula-based methods often yield
redundant or economically ungrounded expres-
sions that generalize poorly. Although different
in form, these paradigms share a key limita-
tion: none can conduct broad, structured, and
human-like exploration that balances logical
consistency with creative leaps. To address this
gap, we introduce theCognitive Alpha Mining
Framework (CogAlpha), which combines code-
level alpha representation with LLM-driven rea-
soning and evolutionary search. Treating LLMs
as adaptive cognitive agents, our framework it-
eratively refines, mutates, and recombines al-
pha candidates through multi-stage prompts
and financial feedback. This synergistic de-
sign enables deeper thinking, richer structural
diversity, and economically interpretable alpha
discovery, while greatly expanding the effective
search space. Experiments on 5 stock datasets
from 3 stock markets demonstrate that CogAl-
pha consistently discovers alphas with supe-
rior predictive accuracy, robustness, and gen-
eralization over existing methods. Our results
highlight the promise of aligning evolutionary
optimization with LLM-based reasoning for au-
tomated and explainable alpha discovery.
1 Introduction
Alpha mining is the process of discovering predic-
tive financial signals, or “alphas,” from financial
markets such as the stock market to forecast future
asset returns. However, since financial markets are
*Corresponding author
characterized by high dimensionality, time-varying
volatility (Engle, 1982), and a low signal-to-noise
ratio, it remains challenging to identify explainable,
reliable, and diverse alphas that support sustainable
profitability and effective risk management. Over
the decades, alpha mining has undergone several
major transformations: from manual construction,
to machine learning–driven automation, and more
recently, to generative and reasoning-based explo-
ration using LLMs (Guo et al., 2024a).
In the earliest stage, alpha factors were manually
designed by financial experts, grounded in eco-
nomic intuition and empirical observation. Classic
examples include the Fama–French factors (Fama
and French, 1992) and various documented finan-
cial anomalies (Harvey et al., 2016; Hou et al.,
2017). These human-crafted alphas are inter-
pretable and theoretically sound. However, the
design process is inherently labor-intensive and in-
efficient. As financial markets became increasingly
complex and data-rich, manual approaches strug-
gled to scale, resulting in diminishing returns and
crowding among similar strategies.
To enhance efficiency, researchers began lever-
aging machine learning models for alpha discov-
ery. Some studies directly employed neural net-
works (Duan et al., 2022; Xu et al., 2021a,b) to
implicitly extract complex and nonlinear alpha
structures from market data through deep learn-
ing. These neural approaches demonstrate strong
predictive power and the ability to capture high-
dimensional and nonlinear dependencies. However,
they also suffer from inherent weaknesses: such
models often behave as black boxes, making it diffi-
cult to trace the underlying decision logic or assess
their robustness under changing market conditions.
As a result, their performance tends to degrade
when exposed to regime shifts or unseen patterns.
In contrast, formula-based approaches (Zhang et al.,
2020, 2023) aim to identify alphas represented by
explicit mathematical expressions. Many methods
11715

based on genetic programming (GP) (Cui et al.,
2021; Lin et al., 2019; Patil, 2023; Schmidt and
Lipson, 2010; Su et al., 2022) and reinforcement
learning (RL) (Liu et al., 2021; Yu et al., 2023; Shi
et al., 2025a) frameworks have been proposed to au-
tomatically search symbolic formula spaces. These
methods provide transparent expressions that are
easy to reproduce and evaluate. Nonetheless, the re-
sulting formulas are often overly complex or redun-
dant and frequently lack solid economic or finan-
cial rationale, causing weak generalization and lim-
ited stability in real trading environments. Despite
their differences, both neural and formula-based
paradigms share a common limitation: their search
processes are inefficient and narrow in scope. Nei-
ther can emulate human-like reasoning that com-
bines logical consistency with leap-style creativity,
leaving a critical gap between algorithmic explo-
ration and genuine conceptual innovation.
Recently, LLMs (Li et al., 2025) have been in-
troduced into alpha mining due to their knowledge
integration, abstraction, and generative reasoning
capabilities. LLMs can synthesize financial knowl-
edge and propose novel formulaic representations
at scale. Nevertheless, most existing LLM-based
approaches (Shi et al., 2025b; Tang et al., 2025)
still rely on formula stacking and pattern repetition
rather than genuine reasoning or structural inno-
vation. As a result, the generated factors tend to
be redundant and susceptible to crowding effects,
which limits their sustainability in dynamic mar-
ket environments. The key research gap lies in
how to evolve LLMs from merepattern replica-
torsinto genuinecognitive thinkers. Specifically,
there remains an unmet need for frameworks that
enable LLMs to perform deeper thinking, richer
structural diversity, and economically grounded
exploration, thereby improving the long-term sta-
bility and robustness of the discovered alpha fac-
tors. Achieving this would move the field beyond
brute-force search or shallow formula generation
toward a more knowledge-driven and explainable
paradigm for alpha discovery.
To bridge this gap, we propose a novel frame-
work namedCogAlpha(Cognitive Alpha Mining).
The name highlights two key aspects of our ap-
proach:CognitiveandAlpha. The termCognitive
refers to leveraging iterative feedback from prior
generations and agents to enable adaptive genera-
tion, thereby moving beyond shallow pattern recog-
nition toward human-like analytical reasoning. The
termAlphacorresponds to the central goal of dis-
covering profitable signals in quantitative finance.
By integrating an evolutionary search process that
induces deeper thinking in LLMs, together with
a seven-level agent hierarchy and a multi-agent
quality checker, COGALPHAnaturally embodies
our vision of advancing toward Cognitive Alpha
Mining.
The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-
lows. Section 2 reviews related work on LLM-
driven alpha mining and deeper LLM thinking. Sec-
tion 3 presents the proposed CogAlpha framework
in detail, highlighting its seven-level agent hier-
archy, multi-agent quality checker, and thinking
evolution components. Section 4 states the experi-
mental setting and reports experimental results on
five different stock datasets, with a primary focus
on the CSI300, demonstrating the superiority of
our approach. Section 5 concludes the paper and
outlines promising directions for future research.
The main contributions of this work are summa-
rized as follows:
• We introduce the concept ofCognitive Alpha
Mining, which opens a new direction for auto-
mated, robust, and explainable alpha discov-
ery, and we formalize it through the proposed
COGALPHAframework.
• We propose a novel method, COGALPHA,
which leverages an evolutionary search pro-
cess that induces deeper thinking in LLMs,
together witha Seven-Level Agent Hierarchy
anda Multi-Agent Quality Checker.
• Extensive experiments on five datasets from 3
stock markets demonstrate the effectiveness of
COGALPHAframework. The alphas extracted
by our method exhibit stronger predictive per-
formance, greater stability, and improved in-
terpretability compared with baselines.
2 Related Work
Alpha Mining with LLMAlpha mining is a fun-
damental task in quantitative finance, aimed at dis-
covering predictive signals, i.e., alpha factors, for
stock markets. Previous approaches have primarily
relied on human experts (Fama and French, 1992),
genetic programming (GP) (Cui et al., 2021; Lin
et al., 2019; Patil, 2023; Schmidt and Lipson, 2010;
Su et al., 2022), reinforcement learning (RL) (Liu
et al., 2021; Yu et al., 2023; Shi et al., 2025a), or
deep learning (Duan et al., 2022; Xu et al., 2021a,b)
to explore the vast factor space. However, these
11716

## PDF page 3

methods all have inherent limitations: they may be
inefficient, produce overly complex solutions, or
suffer from limited interpretability.
Recently, LLMs, with their extensive world
knowledge and strong reasoning capabilities, have
been introduced into alpha mining. For exam-
ple, AutoAlpha (Kou et al., 2024) employs LLMs
to evaluate and select superior alpha candidates,
and agentic frameworks have also been incorpo-
rated to enhance adaptivity and automation. Al-
phaAgent (Tang et al., 2025) introduces an agent-
based architecture with regularization strategies
to mine decay-resistant alpha factors, AlphaJun-
gle (Shi et al., 2025b) presents an LLM-powered
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework in
which the LLM performs multi-step formula refine-
ment, and RD-Agent(Q) (Li et al., 2025) proposes
a data-centric feedback loop with factor–model co-
optimization that enables continuous factor adap-
tation under dynamic market conditions. However,
despite these advances, existing LLM-based alpha
mining methods still rely on formulaic search repre-
sentations, which restrict exploration to shallow re-
gions of the factor space and fail to fully align with
LLMs’ strengths in reasoning and code generation.
In contrast, we leverage LLMs to directly perform
code-based evolution, enabling exploration of a
broader and deeper search space.
Evolving LLM ThinkingTo further explore the
potential of large language models (LLMs), nu-
merous methods have been proposed to enhance
their thinking and reasoning capabilities. Recent
studies have investigated integrating genetic and
evolutionary algorithms (EAs) with LLMs. For ex-
ample, Mind Evolution (Lee et al., 2025) employs
an evolutionary search strategy to scale inference-
time computation in large language models. Wiz-
ardLM (Xu et al., 2024) enhances LLM perfor-
mance by automatically generating large volumes
of open-domain instructions across diverse topics
and difficulty levels. EvoPrompt (Guo et al., 2024b)
combines evolutionary algorithms with LLMs to
optimize prompts using operators such as initializa-
tion, selection, crossover, mutation, and evaluation,
all guided by an LLM; this approach outperforms
both human-designed and traditional automated
prompts. FunSearch (Romera-Paredes et al., 2024)
applies an LLM-guided evolutionary search to dis-
cover mathematical heuristics, excelling in con-
structing novel mathematical objects and advanc-
ing algorithmic discovery. AlphaEvolve (Novikov
et al., 2025) further scales this idea by introduc-
ing an autonomous evolutionary coding pipeline,
where LLMs generate code variants and evalua-
tors iteratively assess and refine them. Beyond
these studies, evolutionary approaches combined
with LLMs have also been explored in text gen-
eration (Xiao and Chen, 2023; Jobanputra et al.,
2025) and code generation (Pinna et al., 2024; Hem-
berg et al., 2024). Despite these advances, none
of the existing works specifically focus on extract-
ing effective signals from highly volatile financial
markets. To this end, we propose COGALPHA,
which leverages an evolutionary search process
that induces deeper thinking in LLMs, in collab-
oration with a seven-level agent hierarchy and a
multi-agent quality checker, to generate robust and
interpretable alpha factors.
3 Approach
The Cognitive Alpha Mining Framework
(COGALPHA) is designed to simulate human-like
reasoning and discover more sophisticated, logical,
and interpretable alpha solutions. It employs an
evolutionary search strategy that induces deeper
thinking in LLMs, together with a seven-level
agent hierarchy and a multi-agent quality checker,
to perform alpha mining. Each alpha produced by
CogAlphais accompanied by detailed comments
that explain its logic, clarify its underlying
idea, and present the corresponding formula.
Following the comments, the implementation code
is provided. In this section, we introduce the core
components of COGALPHAand explain how each
part functions within the overall framework.
3.1 Seven-Level Agent Hierarchy
The only raw factors available areopen,high,low,
close, andvolume(OHLCV). Based on the five
factors, we design a seven-level agent hierarchy
to explore alphas as comprehensively as possible.
This hierarchy consists of 21 unique agents. As
shown in Figure 2, from a macroscopic (Level I) to
a microscopic (Level VII) perspective, these agents
are organized into seven hierarchical levels. Each
agent is dedicated to exploring a distinct alpha-
discovery direction and independently generates
a set of alpha factors according to its designated
exploration strategy. The following provides a brief
overview of each level’s exploration domain, and
more details are provided in Appendix A.1.
11717

## PDF page 4

Level I: Market Structure & Cycle Layer
(AgentMarketCycle,AgentVolatilityRegime) — Ex-
plores large-scale temporal structures such as long-
term trends, market phases, and cyclical state tran-
sitions inferred from daily OHLCV dynamics.
Level II: Extreme Risk & Fragility Layer
(AgentTailRisk,AgentCrashPredictor) — Models
tail-risk exposure, crash precursors, and systemic
fragility patterns that indicate potential regime
breakdowns or stress accumulation.
Level III: Price–Volume Dynamics Layer
(AgentLiquidity,AgentOrderImbalance,Agent-
PriceVolumeCoherence,AgentVolumeStructure) —
Captures the interaction between price and trading
activity—liquidity, order imbalance, and coherence
between price movement and volume behavior.
Level IV: Price–Volatility Behavior Layer
(AgentDailyTrend,AgentReversal,AgentRangeVol,
AgentLagResponse,AgentVolAsymmetry) — Ana-
lyzes trend persistence, short-term reversal, volatil-
ity clustering, and asymmetric price dynamics as
the core source of predictive alpha.
Level V: Multi-Scale Complexity Layer(Agent-
Drawdown,AgentFractal) — Measures cross-scale
irregularity, fractal roughness, drawdown–recovery
geometry, and long-memory characteristics in time-
series structure.
Level VI: Stability & Regime-Gating Layer
(AgentRegimeGating,AgentStability) — Assesses
temporal stability and constructs adaptive gating
mechanisms that regulate signal activation under
varying market conditions.
Level VII: Geometric & Fusion Layer(Agent-
BarShape,AgentCreative,AgentComposite,Agen-
tHerding) — Focuses on geometric pattern rep-
resentation (candlestick morphology) and multi-
factor fusion, combining independent signals into
coherent composites.
3.2 Diversified Guidance
To achieve more precise and comprehensive ex-
ploration along each alpha-discovery direction, we
extend the original guidance generation with five
paraphrasing modes:light,moderate,creative,di-
vergent, andconcrete. Thelightversion performs
minimal rewording to maintain almost identical
meaning, ensuring linguistic consistency for base-
line comparison. Themoderateversion introduces
natural phrasing variations to enrich expression
while keeping the same analytical focus. Thecre-
ativeversion adds interpretative depth and research-
oriented nuance to inspire alternative reasoning
within the same conceptual boundary. Thediver-
gentversion explores new but related analytical
perspectives, helping generate complementary hy-
potheses beyond the original phrasing. Finally, the
concreteversion transforms abstract descriptions
into measurable, implementation-oriented forms by
specifying possible formulas, ratios, or statistical
operations. Together, these five paraphrasing styles
enable broader semantic coverage and deeper fac-
tor reasoning without departing from the original
analytical intent. More details about those para-
phrasing modes are provided in Appendix A.2.
3.3 Multi-Agent Quality Checker
To verify the validity and quality of the gener-
ated alpha codes, we design aMulti-Agent Quality
Checker—comprising theJudge Agent,Logic Im-
provement Agent,Code Quality Agent, andCode
Repair Agent. All alpha codes that pass the quality
checker are stored in the candidate pool; otherwise,
invalid codes are sent back to the multi-agent sys-
tem for repair. Codes that cannot be repaired or
improved after several attempts are discarded.
As illustrated in Figure 1, theCode Quality
Agentfirst detects issues such as syntax errors, for-
matting inconsistencies, and runtime bugs. If such
issues are found, theCode Repair Agentattempts to
fix the problematic alpha codes based on the feed-
back provided by theCode Quality Agent. Next,
theJudge Agentevaluates whether an alpha factor
is logically consistent, technically correct, and eco-
nomically meaningful. If improvement is needed,
theLogic Improvement Agentrefines and enhances
alpha codes that fail theJudge Agent’s assessment.
After passing all quality checks, each code is exe-
cuted. We evaluate numerical stability by detecting
runtime errors, the proportion ofNaNvalues, over-
flow/underflow, and distinct values per day. Codes
that fail are either rejected or sent back to earlier
agents for correction. If it runs successfully, a unit
test is performed to examine potential information
leakage. Codes that pass the unit test are deemed
qualified and stored in the candidate pool. More
details are shown in Appendix A.3.
3.4 Fitness Evaluation
After passing the Multi-Agent Quality Checker,
each alpha is evaluated using five predictive power
metrics: Information Coefficient (IC), Information

Figure 1:Overview of CogAlpha.The Seven-Level Agent Hierarchy produces initial alphas derived from the
OHLCV data. The Multi-Agent Quality Checker verifies the validity and quality of each generated alpha code. The
Filtering module evaluates all alpha codes using five predictive power metrics. Finally, the Thinking Evolution
module iteratively refines and recombines qualified candidates through deeper reasoning by LLMs in each iteration.
Coefficient Information Ratio (ICIR), Rank Infor-
mation Coefficient (RankIC), Rank Information
Coefficient Information Ratio (RankICIR), and
Mutual Information (MI). The first 4 metrics mea-
sure the linear relationship between the alpha and
the target return, whereasMIcaptures the nonlin-
ear dependency between them. Detailed definitions
of these metrics are provided in Appendix B.3.
We set threshold values to identifyqualifiedand
elitealphas. Alphas whose five evaluation metrics
all exceed the 65th percentile among all alphas in
the same generation are classified asqualified al-
phas, while those exceeding the 80th percentile are
consideredelite alphas. We constrain each metric
by a minimum bound to prevent the dominance
of outliers:ICandRankICare bounded below by
0.005,ICIRandRankICIRby 0.05, andMIby
0.02. For elite factors, the minimum bounds are
slightly higher: 0.01 forICandRankIC, 0.1 for
ICIRandRankICIR, and 0.02 forMI. The qualified
alphas form the new parent pool and are passed
to the next iteration, whereas the elite alphas are
carried forward and stored in the final candidate
pool. Additionally, the top two elite alphas from
the previous generation are carried forward to the
next generation to preserve high-quality solutions.
3.5 Adaptive Generation
After each fitness evaluation, there exists a popula-
tion of valid alphas and another of invalid alphas,
each with different underlying causes. To ensure
that agents can continuously learn from previous
generations, information about both valid and in-
valid alphas is incorporated into the prompt. For
each generation, we randomly select two valid al-
phas and two worst-performing invalid alphas as
guiding samples. Each selected alpha is first ana-
lyzed and summarized to explain why it is valid or
invalid. Subsequently, the combined fitness results
and analytical summaries of the selected alphas are
incorporated into the generation prompts, based on
which new alphas are generated.
3.6 Thinking Evolution
To guide the LLM to reason more deeply about
alpha searching, we employThinking Evolution
to enhance its alpha-mining capability. All qual-
ified alphas are evolved through this process. As
illustrated in Figure 1,Thinking Evolutionimple-
ments a genetic-style optimization process in natu-
ral language space, where candidate alpha codes un-
dergo mutation and crossover operations expressed
through textual prompts. It consists of 2 agents: the
Mutation Agentand theCrossover Agent. TheMu-
tation Agentslightly modifies a given alpha code to
introduce variability, whereas theCrossover Agent
generates a new alpha code by combining two ex-
isting ones. Three types of evolution are conducted:
mutation only, crossover only, and crossover fol-
lowed by mutation. After each evolution step, the
11719

## PDF page 6

resulting alpha codes are examined by the Multi-
Agent Quality Checker. This process continues
until all generations are completed.
4 Experiments
In this section, we first describe the experimental
settings and compare our framework with the base-
lines. Then, we demonstrate the interpretability
and evolutionary process of the generated alphas.
Finally, we study the sensitivity of our method to
different metric thresholds.
4.1 Experimental Settings
DatasetsOur experiments are mainly conducted
on the CSI300 (China Securities Index 300). Its
components consist of 300 large-cap A-share
stocks in the Chinese market. We primarily use
the 10-day return as the prediction target, with
buying and selling at the open price. The dataset
is split chronologically into training (2011/01/01-
2019/12/31), validation (2020/01/01-2020/12/31),
and test (2021/01/01-2024/12/01) periods. Four
other datasets (CSI500, S&P500, HSI, and HSCI)
from three different stock markets (China, U.S. and
HK) are also tested. More details and results are
provided in Appendix B.1 and Appendix B.11.
ModelIn our paper, all agents are based ongpt-
oss-120b(OpenAI, 2025a) by default. For the
task-specific agents in the seven-level agent hierar-
chy and the thinking-evolution agents, the tempera-
ture is randomly selected from {0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0,
1.1, 1.2} to encourage diversity. For the agents in
the multi-agent quality checker, the temperature is
fixed at 0.8. The maximum token length is set to
4096. By default, LightGBM (Ke et al., 2017) is
used to train the alphas generated by our method.
Training SettingThe size of the initial pool is
set to 80, meaning that the minimum number of
alphas generated by the task-specific agents is 80.
The parent pool size is set to 32, indicating that
after filtering, at most 32 alphas are retained and
passed to the next generation. The children’s pool
is set to be three times the size of the parent pool,
meaning that the minimum number of alphas gen-
erated by the evolutionary agents is 96. By default,
each task-specific agent leads a complete evolu-
tionary cycle, which consists of 24 generations and
3 inner sub-cycles, with each sub-cycle compris-
ing 8 generations. Thus, each task-specific agent
initiates the evolutionary search 3 times. In addi-
tion, every 2 generations, new alphas generated
by the task-specific agents are filtered and injected
into the parent pool. For each generation, the top
two elite alphas from the previous generation are
always carried forward to the next. All alphas con-
taining more than 30% NaN values or failing the
multi-agent quality checker are discarded. All ex-
periments are conducted on NVIDIA H100 GPUs.
EvaluationWe use four predictive power metrics
to evaluate the performance of alpha combinations:
the Information Coefficient (IC), Information Co-
efficient Information Ratio (ICIR), Rank Informa-
tion Coefficient (RankIC), and Rank Information
Coefficient Information Ratio (RankICIR). The
ICmeasures the linear correlation between alpha
values and subsequent total returns, reflecting the
overall predictive power of the alpha. TheICIR
quantifies the stability and temporal consistency
ofIC. TheRankICandRankICIRare similar to
ICandICIR, respectively, but they measure the
monotonic relationship between the alpha and sub-
sequent total returns rather than linear correlation.
In addition, two performance indicators are em-
ployed: the Information Ratio (IR) and Annualized
Excess Return (AER). TheIRevaluates the risk-
adjusted excess return, and theAERmeasures the
annualized excess cumulative return over a given
period. Detailed definitions and formulas of these
metrics are provided in Appendix B.3.
4.2 Comparison with Baselines
We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of CO-
GALPHAby comparing it against 21 benchmark
methods from various application domains (see Ta-
ble 1). First, we select 7 commonly used machine
learning models in quantitative finance: Linear Re-
gression, MLP, Random Forest (Breiman, 2001),
LightGBM (Ke et al., 2017), XGBoost (Chen and
Guestrin, 2016), CatBoost (Prokhorenkova et al.,
2018), and AdaBoost (Freund and Schapire, 1997).
Next, we include 4 representative deep learning
models: GRU (Cho et al., 2014), LSTM (Hochre-
iter and Schmidhuber, 1997), CNN (LeCun et al.,
2002), and Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017). We
further incorporate two widely used alpha libraries,
Alpha-158 (Microsoft, 2025a) and Alpha-360 (Mi-
crosoft, 2025b), as baseline factor sets. We also
include two closely related automated alpha min-
ing methods, AutoAlpha (Kou et al., 2024) and Al-
phaAgent (Tang et al., 2025), for comparison. In ad-
dition, six LLMs are evaluated to assess their capac-
ity for alpha mining. Among them, two are closed-
source models: GPT-4.1 (OpenAI, 2025), a non-

reasoning model, and o3 (OpenAI, 2025b), a rea-
soning model. The remaining four are open-source
models of different scales and origins: Llama3-8B,
Llama3-70B (Grattafiori et al., 2024), GPT-OSS-
20B, and GPT-OSS-120B (OpenAI, 2025a). For
methods and LLMs that generate alpha factors, we
evaluate performance using multi-factor combina-
tions constructed from the 20 generated alphas.
As shown in Table 1, traditional machine learn-
ing methods generally exhibit better overall perfor-
mance than deep learning methods. There is no sub-
stantial performance gap between traditional ma-
chine learning models and existing alpha libraries
or LLM-driven methods that mine formulaic alphas.
Moreover, from the four predictive metrics of AL-
PHA158 and ALPHA360, we observe that a larger
number of alpha factors does not necessarily lead
to higher IC or RankIC values. For open-source
LLMs, larger models generally exhibit stronger
alpha-mining capabilities than smaller ones. Sur-
prisingly, the two closed-source models perform
poorly, with the reasoning-oriented model achiev-
ing the worst performance among all evaluated
LLMs. Overall, COGALPHAconsistently outper-
forms all baseline methods, achieving superior re-
sults across all evaluation metrics. The only ex-
ception is the Random Forest model, which may
be attributed to the fact that the signals generated
by Random Forest exhibit highly stable RankIC
values with very low standard deviation, leading to
a higher RankICIR.
4.3 Ablation Study
In this section, we evaluate the effectiveness of each
component of CogAlapha: Adaptive Generation
(A), Diversified Guidance (G), Seven-Level Agent
Hierarchy (H), and Thinking Evolution (E). As
shown in Table 3 in Appendix B.7, the four parts
can, to some extent, improve the effectiveness and
performance of alpha mining.
4.4 Interpretability of Generated Alpha
In this section, we analyze the interpretability of
the generated alphas. Each alpha produced byCo-
gAlphais accompanied by detailed comments that
explain its logic, clarify its underlying idea, and
present the corresponding formula. Following the
comments, the implementation code is provided.
The Python code in Listing 1 is an example of
a generated alpha. It measures theliquidity im-
pact: the price rise (high – close) per unit of traded
volume.
Alpha = dayhigh−dayclose
dayvolume +ε .(1)
A large positive value indicates that the stock price
increased sharply while trading volume remained
low, implying thin liquidity and a higher expected
short-term return. This design can be interpreted as
a measure of theprice impact per unit of traded vol-
ume. In market microstructure theory, this reflects
11721

the liquidity constraint between price movements
and trading volume: large price changes under low
volume often signal poor liquidity, an imbalanced
order book, and markets where small trades can
move prices significantly. Such conditions may im-
ply short-term reversal or momentum effects, con-
sistent with the findings ofContinuous Auctions
and Insider Trading(Kyle, 1985) andIlliquidity
and Stock Returns(Amihud, 2002) on price impact
and illiquidity-return relationships.

4.5 Evolution of Alphas
To demonstrate the evolution capability ofCogAl-
pha, we show an example of how liquidity-related
alphas evolve over multiple iterations. Each gen-
erated alpha is evaluated by predictive metrics (IC
and RankIC). Poorly performing alphas are auto-
matically filtered out, while stronger ones are pre-
served and further evolved.
The first version (Listing 1) represents an initial
manually designed alpha. It measures the liquidity
impact as the price rise (high−close)per unit
of traded volume. Its metrics are:IC: 0.0090,
RankIC: 0.0061. Through mutation, the model
generates an alternative formulation (Listing 2 in
Appendix B.9) that uses the full daily price range
(high−low)instead of the closing difference. This
captures broader intraday liquidity behavior. Its
metrics slightly decrease toIC: 0.0073,RankIC:
0.0021, and thus this version is discarded in later
rounds. After several evolutionary rounds, CogAl-
pha produces a more refined version (Listing 3 in
Appendix B.9). It normalizes the absolute daily
price move by dollar volume and applies a tanh
transformation to ensure boundedness and robust-
ness. The evolved alpha achieves significantly im-
proved performance withIC: 0.0141andRankIC:
0.0087, showing the ability of the evolutionary
mechanism to refine quantitative factors effectively.
After a complete evolution cycle, CogAlpha is
able to generate a large number of single-factor al-
phas with strong predictive power, many of which
achieveabsolute IC values above 0.05andab-
solute RankIC values above 0.07. This demon-
strates the framework’s capacity to autonomously
explore and optimize factor space toward higher-
performing and more interpretable alphas.
4.6 Generalization to Different Settings
To test the generalization of CogAlpha, we con-
duct experiments on five different datasets (CSI300,
CSI500, S&P500, HSI, HSCI) from three differ-
ent stock markets (China, U.S., and HK), using
two training methods (LightGBM and Ridge) and
two prediction horizons (10 days and 30 days). As
shown in Table 5 in Appendix B.11, our method
consistently performs well across different settings.
4.7 Different Fitness Threshold
In this section, we analyze the sensitivity of our
method to different threshold settings used for fil-
tering alpha factors. To maintain the quality of the
selected alphas, we experiment with three threshold
pairs: (65, 80), (80, 90), and (85, 95). In each pair,
the former value represents the percentile thresh-
old forqualified factorsthat advance to the next
generation, while the latter corresponds to the per-
centile threshold forelite factorsthat are directly
stored in the final candidate pool. For compari-
son, we also establish a baseline configuration to
ensure the quality consistency of filtered alphas.
Specifically, thresholds for each predictive metric
are determined based on the empirical distribution
of factor scores. We constrain each metric by a min-
imum bound to prevent the dominance of outliers:
ICandRankICare bounded below by 0.005,ICIR
andRankICIRby 0.05, andMIby 0.02. For elite
factors, the minimum bounds are slightly higher:
0.01 forICandRankIC, 0.1 forICIRandRankI-
CIR, and 0.02 forMI. As shown in Figure 3 in
Appendix B.10, the threshold pair (65, 80) yields
better overall performance. This result may be at-
tributed to the larger parent pool size under this con-
figuration, which encourages evolutionary search
to explore a broader alpha space and mitigates the
risk of premature convergence to local optima.
5 Conclusion
In this work, we study how to extract interpretable
and reliable alpha signals from financial markets
characterized by high volatility and a low signal-to-
noise ratio. We introduce the concept ofCognitive
Alpha Mining, which opens a new direction for
automated, robust, and explainable alpha discov-

ery. We further propose COGALPHA, a multi-agent
framework powered by deeper-thinking LLMs. Ex-
tensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach. In future work, we plan to imple-
ment our method in live trading environments to
further validate its practical performance.
Limitations
The CogAlpha framework is intended for academic
use only and does not provide any financial opin-
ions. The backtesting simulations are implemented
and executed entirely within the Qlib framework,
which may not fully replicate the conditions of live
trading environments. Additionally, due to the in-
herent randomness of LLM outputs, reproducing
exactly the same alphas in each run can be chal-
lenging. Furthermore, the execution time of the
experiments is influenced by the size of the dataset,
with larger datasets potentially leading to longer
processing times.
Ethical Considerations
All datasets used in this paper were downloaded
from public sources and are publicly available.
We used OpenAI’s ChatGPT-5.2 for grammar
checking and suggestions, but manually verified
all edits. No AI-generated content was directly
included in the final submission.
Users of the CogAlpha framework and its related
code are responsible for sourcing their own finan-
cial data and independently evaluating the risks
associated with the generated factors and models
in their specific contexts. It is crucial to approach
the agent-generated code, data, and models with
care and perform comprehensive verification. The
CogAlpha framework does not offer financial ad-
vice and is not intended to substitute the expertise
of qualified financial professionals in the creation,
evaluation, and approval of financial products.

•Level 1: Market Structure & Cycle Layer
AgentMarketCycleexplores long-term cycli-

A.2 Diversified Guidance
• Light: Performs minimal rewording to main-
tain nearly identical meaning while improv-
ing clarity and linguistic fluency. It serves
as a baseline for consistency testing across
linguistic variations.
• Moderate: Rephrases the content naturally
with mild enrichment or stylistic variation.
This helps capture nuanced semantic differ-
ences and tests factor robustness under slightly
altered descriptive framing.
• Creative: Introduces expressive, research-
oriented rewording that adds interpretative
depth. This style aims to inspire novel ana-
lytical angles or alternative reasoning patterns
that remain aligned with the original domain.

Level Layer Name Description
I Market Structure & Cycle Layer Explores large-scale temporal structures such as long-
term trends, market phases, and cyclical state transitions
inferred from daily OHLCV dynamics.
II Extreme Risk & Fragility Layer Models tail-risk exposure, crash precursors, and sys-
temic fragility patterns that signal potential regime break-
downs or stress accumulation.
III Price–V olume Dynamics Layer Captures the interactions between price and trading activ-
ity—liquidity, order imbalance, and coherence between
price movement and volume behavior.
IV Price–V olatility Behavior Layer Analyzes trend persistence, short-term reversals, volatil-
ity clustering, and asymmetric price dynamics as core
sources of predictive alpha.
V Multi-Scale Complexity Layer Measures cross-scale irregularities, fractal roughness,
drawdown–recovery geometry, and long-memory char-
acteristics in time-series structures.
VI Stability & Regime-Gating Layer Assesses temporal stability and constructs adaptive gat-
ing mechanisms that regulate signal activation under
varying market conditions.
VII Geometric & Fusion Layer Focuses on geometric pattern representation (candlestick
morphology) and multi-factor fusion, combining inde-
pendent signals into coherent composite factors.

• Divergent: Produces exploratory rewrites
from new but relevant analytical viewpoints,
often shifting emphasis toward different sub-
mechanisms within the same conceptual
framework. This encourages broader hypothe-
sis generation and factor diversity.

and implementation-oriented by introducing
measurable quantities such as statistical for-
mulas, ratios, or example computations. This
version bridges conceptual factor ideas with
practical implementation cues.
A.3 Multi-Agent Quality Checker
As shown in Figure 1, the Multi-Agent Quality
Checker operates through the following sequence:
Code Quality Agent.It performs the first-pass
audit of the raw LLM-generated code. It de-
tects syntactic errors, undefined variables, format-
ting inconsistencies, invalid library calls, and po-
tential runtime failures using static analysis and
lightweight interpreter checks. This agent ensures
that the code is structurally well-formed before
deeper semantic inspection takes place.
Code Repair Agent.If the Code Quality Agent
identifies issues, the Code Repair Agent attempts
to fix them autonomously. Repairs include correct-
ing import statements, rewriting malformed expres-
sions, resolving type mismatches, and rewriting
unstable numerical operations. This agent ensures
that the factor is at least syntactically and opera-
tionally viable.
Judge Agent.Once the code is syntactically
clean, the Judge Agent evaluates the factor at a
semantic level. It assesses whether the factor is:
• Logically consistent: correct operator ordering,
coherent data flow, no degenerate expressions;
• Technically correct: valid use of rolling win-
dows, transforms, and TA-Lib functions;
• Economically meaningful: obeys financial intu-
ition and avoids fabricated indicators.
11727

## PDF page 14

Factors that fail this semantic audit are routed to
the Logic Improvement Agent.
Logic Improvement Agent.This agent refines
factors that exhibit weak or inconsistent logic. It
restructures formulas, adjusts window parameters,
replaces dubious transformations, eliminates redun-
dant operations, and enhances the overall financial
interpretability while preserving the original mod-
eling intent. This refinement improves robustness
without altering the factor’s core hypothesis.
Execution and Numerical Stability Check.Af-
ter passing the logical audits, the code is executed
in a restricted sandbox. We evaluate numerical
stability by detecting runtime errors,NaNpropaga-
tion, overflow/underflow, invalid logarithms, and
unstable normalizations. Codes that fail are re-
jected or sent back to earlier agents for correction.
Temporal Leakage Unit Test.Finally, Static
Safety conducts a domain-specific leakage test to
ensure that the factor does not use future informa-
tion. This test detects forward-looking shifts (e.g.,
shift(-1)), misaligned rolling windows, or im-
plicit temporal violations that may pass standard
code-safety tools. Only factors with zero leakage
are accepted.
Output.Codes that pass all agents form a pool
of safe, executable, and leakage-free alpha factors.
These factors constitute the foundation for the next
stage,Thinking Evolution, which focuses on im-
proving reasoning reliability and logical effective-
ness. By enforcing strict correctness at the code
level first, CogAlpha ensures that all evolution oc-
curs on top of a solid and trustworthy computa-
tional base.
A.4 Fitness Evaluation
The threshold values for the five predictive power
metrics may vary depending on the dataset. For
example, on the CSI300, we constrain each metric
with a minimum bound to prevent the dominance
of outliers:ICandRankICare bounded below by
0.005,ICIRandRankICIRby 0.05, andMIby
0.02. For elite factors, the minimum bounds are
slightly higher: 0.01 forICandRankIC, 0.1 for
ICIRandRankICIR, and 0.02 forMI. However,
on the S&P500, we apply similar constraints to
prevent the dominance of outliers:ICandRankIC
are bounded below by 0.005,ICIRandRankICIR
by 0.05, andMIby 0.012. For elite factors, the
minimum bounds are slightly higher: 0.01 forIC
andRankIC, 0.1 forICIRandRankICIR, and 0.012
forMI. This is because it is harder to mine alpha
signals in a more effective stock market.
Non-linear relationships (e.g., MI) suggest that
the market may not be fully efficient, and certain
information may not be fully reflected in prices,
thus providing opportunities for factor investing.
Non-linear factor models are better able to capture
complex patterns in the market and may offer op-
portunities for excess returns, especially when the
market is not fully efficient.
B Experiments
B.1 Datasets
Our experiments are mainly conducted on the
CSI300 (China Securities Index 300). Its com-
ponents consist of 300 large-cap A-share stocks
in the Chinese market. We primarily use the
10-day return as the prediction target, with buy-
ing and selling at the open price. The dataset
is split chronologically into training (2011/01/01-
2019/12/31), validation (2020/01/01-2020/12/31),
and test (2021/01/01-2024/12/01) periods. On the
same dataset, we also use a 30-day return as the
prediction target.
CSI500 (China Securities Index 500) consists
of 500 relatively smaller but liquid companies in
China. We primarily use the 10-day return as the
prediction target, with buying and selling at the
open price. The dataset is split chronologically
into training (2011/01/01-2019/12/31), validation
(2020/01/01-2020/12/31), and test (2021/01/01-
2024/12/01) periods.
Three other datasets from two different stock
markets (U.S. and HK) are also used. The S&P500
is the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, and its com-
ponents include 500 of the largest publicly traded
companies in the U.S. stock market. The dataset
is split chronologically into training (2007/01/01-
2014/12/31), validation (2015/01/01-2015/12/31),
and test (2016/01/01-2020/12/01) periods.
The HSI (Hang Seng Index) tracks the perfor-
mance of the largest and most liquid companies
listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Cur-
rently, according to (AASTocks, 2025), it has
89 stocks. The dataset is split chronologically
into training (2011/01/01-2019/12/31), validation
(2020/01/01-2020/12/31), and test (2021/01/01-
2025/12/01) periods.
The HSCI (Hang Seng China Enterprises Index)
covers about the top 95th percentile of the total
11728

## PDF page 15

market capitalization of companies listed on the
Main Board of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong.
Currently, according to (Hang Seng Indexes Com-
pany, 2025), it includes 509 stocks. The dataset
is split chronologically into training (2011/01/01-
2019/12/31), validation (2020/01/01-2020/12/31),
and test (2021/01/01-2025/12/01) periods.
The CSI300, CSI500, and S&P500 datasets are
downloaded from the Qlib platform (Yang et al.,
2020). The HSI and HSCI datasets are downloaded
from Yahoo Finance (Aroussi, 2024). All back-
testing simulations are implemented and executed
entirely within the Qlib framework.
B.2 Backtest
The top-50/drop-5 strategy is a ranking-based port-
folio construction method that selects the top 50
stocks with the highest predicted returns while lim-
iting daily portfolio turnover. On each trading
day, the portfolio retains previously selected high-
ranking stocks and replaces at most5 positions. All
trades are executed at the opening price. The open
cost is set to 0.05%, and the close cost is set to
0.15%. A minimum transaction fee of 5 CNY is
applied to each trade.
B.3 Metrics
We use five factor predictive power metrics: Infor-
mation Coefficient (IC), Information Coefficient
Information Ratio (ICIR), Rank Information Co-
efficient (RankIC), Rank Information Coefficient
Information Ratio (RankICIR), and Mutual Infor-
mation (MI). Assume there are Nt assets at time
t. Letfi,trepresent the predicted returns for asset
i at timet, andrt+1 represent the total return over
the subsequent period, fromt tot+ 1 . The evalu-
ation spans overT time periods. We also use two
performance metrics: AER and IR.
TheInformation Coefficient (IC)measures the
linear correlation between factor values and subse-
quent total returns. It is the average of each linear
cross-sectional relationship between factor values
and subsequent returns at timet over allT periods:
IC = 1

i=1(fi,t−¯ft)2
√∑Nt
i=1(ri,t+1−¯rt+1)2
(2)
TheInformation Coefficient Information Ra-
tio (ICIR)evaluates the stability ofICacross time:
ICIR = E[ICt]
Std[ICt] ≈ IC
Std({ICt}T
t=1),(3)
whereICdenotes the time-averagedIC t.
TheRank Information Coefficient (RankIC)
measures the monotonic relationship between the
factor and the subsequent total returns. Let
ui,t= rank(fi,t), v i,t= rank(ri,t+1),
and their means ¯ut,¯vt acrossNt assets. Analogous
to IC, RankIC over periodTcan be expressed as:
RankIC = 1

i=1(ui,t−¯ut)2
√∑Nt
i=1(vi,t−¯vt)2
.
(4)
Analogous to ICIR, theRankIC Information
Ratio (RankICIR)measures the temporal stability
of RankIC:
RankICIR = E[RankICt]
Std[RankICt] ≈ RankIC
Std({RankICt}T
t=1) .
(5)
TheMutual Information (MI)captures the non-
linear dependence between factor values and the
subsequent total returns. It measures the reduction
in uncertainty ofRgiven knowledge ofF:
MI(F, R) =
∫ ∫
p(f, r) log p(f, r)
p(f)p(r) d f dr,(6)
wherep(f,r) denotes the joint density of factorf
and return r, and p(f), p(r) are their respective
marginal densities. A higher MI implies a stronger
(possibly nonlinear) dependency between the factor
and subsequent returns.
Annualized Excess Return (AER).Following
Qlib’s implementation, we compute daily excess
returns as
rt =r port
t −rbench
t −costt,
where rport
t is the portfolio return, rbench
t is the
benchmark return, and costt is the transaction cost.
The average daily excess return is
µ=1
T
T∑
t=1
rt,
and the annualized excess return is obtained via
arithmetic scaling:
AER =µ×N,
whereN is the number of trading periods in a year
(e.g.,N= 252for daily returns).

B.4 Training Setting
The size of the initial pool is set to 80, meaning that
the minimum number of alphas generated by the
task-specific agents is 80. The parent pool size is
set to 32, indicating that after filtering, at most 32
alphas are retained and passed to the next genera-
tion. The children’s pool is set to be three times the
size of the parent pool, meaning that the minimum
number of alphas generated by the evolutionary
agents is 96. By default, each task-specific agent
leads a complete evolutionary cycle, which consists
of 24 generations and 3 inner sub-cycles, with each
sub-cycle comprising 8 generations. Thus, each
task-specific agent initiates the evolutionary search
3 times. In addition, every 2 generations, new al-
phas generated by the task-specific agents are fil-
tered and injected into the parent pool. For each
generation, the top two elite alphas from the pre-
vious generation are always carried forward to the
next. All alphas containing more than 30% NaN
values or failing the multi-agent quality checker
are discarded. All experiments are conducted on
NVIDIA H100 GPUs.
We use rolling training with a rolling step of
126. Two models are employed in this work: the
LGBMRegressorandRidgemodels. TheLGBMRe-
gressoris configured with a learning rate of 0.0001,
32 leaves per tree, a maximum depth of 12, and
regularization terms (reg_alpha andreg_lambda)
set to 1.0. The model uses a total of 1000 trees with
sampling techniques (feature and bagging fractions
set to 0.8) to reduce overfitting. For theRidge
model, the regularization strength (alpha) is set to
10, which controls the regularization applied to the
model to prevent overfitting.
We employ two stopping conditions for the evo-
lutionary process. By default, evolution runs for
a fixed number of predefined steps. We addition-
ally incorporate a plateau-based early stopping rule,
where we track the elite-pool performance and com-
pute the improvement between two consecutive
windows of lengthplateau_win, defined as
δ= mean(curr)−mean(prev).
Ifδ≤0.001, the evolution for that island or run is
terminated.
B.5 Computational Cost
On the CSI300 dataset, generating a single alpha
factor typically takes 5–9 seconds, and completing
one generation takes approximately 1 hour.
For comparison, deep learning models running
on GPU exhibit the following training times: CNN,
GRU, and LSTM models require around 20 min-
utes, while Transformer-based models take approx-
imately 40 minutes. For traditional machine learn-
ing models running on CPU, AdaBoost requires
around 6 hours, Random Forest takes approxi-
mately 40 minutes, LightGBM completes in about
2 minutes, and linear models typically require only
5–10 seconds.
For all main experiments, we use a single H100
GPU. The evolutionary process is conducted using
a local model ( gpt-oss-120b), which incurs no
API cost.
B.6 Randomness of LLMs
Due to the inherent randomness in the outputs of
large models, the results may vary with each run.
However, factor mining is different from other ex-
periments in that good factors can be accumulated

and stored. Therefore, the experimental results pre-
sented in this paper reflect the outcomes after a
single round of factor mining.
B.7 Ablation Study
We evaluate the effectiveness of each component of
CogAlapha: Adaptive Generation (A), Diversified
Guidance (G), Seven-Level Agent Hierarchy (H),
and Thinking Evolution (E). As shown in Table 3,
the four parts can, to some extent, improve the
effectiveness and performance of alpha mining.
B.8 Hyperparameter Design and Analysis
Our hyperparameter design is inspired by two prior
works (Lee et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2025). In (Lee
et al., 2025), the parent pool size is set to 5 for
each island/agent, with 10 generations per cycle.
In (Zhang et al., 2025), it is suggested that allowing
LLMs to generate a batch of responses (e.g., 5) at
once improves diversity.
In our setting, we employ 21 heterogeneous
agents and adopt the golden ratio, which is com-
monly used in quantitative finance for balanced
allocation, to randomly select 13 agents for con-
structing the initial factor pool. Following (Lee
et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2025), each selected agent
generates approximately 5–6 alpha factors, result-
ing in an initial pool of around 80 factors. We then
apply the golden ratio again to form a parent pool
of size 32. Given three distinct evolution operators,
the resulting children pool size is3×32 = 96.
To analyze the impact of hyperparame-
ters, we conduct ablation experiments on the
AgentMarketCycleagent under different configu-
rations. We denote each configuration asP·_G·_H·,
whereP is the parent pool size,G is the number of
generations per cycle, and H is the length of sub-
cycles. The results on the CSI300 dataset with a
10-day horizon are summarized in Table 4.
From the results, the configurationP32_G24_H2
achieves the best overall performance. Neverthe-
less, other configurations may still yield competi-
tive results and are capable of discovering effective
alpha factors. We therefore argue that there is no
universally optimal hyperparameter setting across
different time periods and market conditions. In-
stead, maintaining diversity in hyperparameter con-
figurations is beneficial for more comprehensive
alpha factor discovery.
B.9 Evolution of Alphas
To demonstrate the evolution capability ofCogAl-
pha, we show an example of how liquidity-related
alphas evolve over multiple iterations. Each gen-
erated alpha is evaluated by predictive metrics (IC
and RankIC). Poorly performing alphas are auto-
matically filtered out, while stronger ones are pre-
served and further evolved.

The first version (Listing 1) represents an initial
manually designed alpha. It measures the liquidity
impact as the price rise (high−close)per unit of
traded volume. Its metrics are:IC: 0.0090,Ran-
kIC: 0.0061. Through mutation, the model gen-
erates an alternative formulation (Listing 2) that
uses the full daily price range(high−low)instead
of the closing difference. This captures broader
intraday liquidity behavior. Its metrics slightly de-
crease toIC: 0.0073,RankIC: 0.0021, and thus
this version is discarded in later rounds.

the ability of the evolutionary mechanism to refine
quantitative factors effectively.
After a complete evolution cycle, CogAlpha is
able to generate a large number of single-factor al-
phas with strong predictive power, many of which

solute RankIC values above 0.07. This demon-
strates the framework’s capacity to autonomously

performing and more interpretable alphas. The

B.10 Different Fitness Threshold
We analyze the sensitivity of our method to dif-
ferent threshold settings used for filtering alpha
factors. To maintain the quality of the selected
alphas, we experiment with three threshold pairs:
(65, 80), (80, 90), and (85, 95). In each pair, the
former value represents the percentile threshold for
qualified factorsthat advance to the next genera-
tion, while the latter corresponds to the percentile
threshold forelite factorsthat are directly stored
in the final candidate pool. For comparison, we
also establish a baseline configuration to ensure
the quality consistency of filtered alphas. Specif-
ically, thresholds for each predictive metric are
determined based on the empirical distribution of
factor scores. We constrain each metric by a mini-
mum bound to prevent the dominance of outliers:
ICandRankICare bounded below by 0.005,ICIR
andRankICIRby 0.05, andMIby 0.02. For elite
factors, the minimum bounds are slightly higher:
0.01 forICandRankIC, 0.1 forICIRandRankI-
CIR, and 0.02 forMI. As shown in Figure 3, the
threshold pair (65, 80) yields better overall perfor-
mance. This result may be attributed to the larger
parent pool size under this configuration, which en-
courages evolutionary search to explore a broader
alpha space and mitigates the risk of premature
convergence to local optima.
B.11 Generalization to Different Settings
We test the generalization of CogAlpha on different
datasets (CSI300, CSI500, S&P500, HSI, HSCI),
training methods (LightGBM, Ridge), and hori-
zons (10 days, 30 days). As shown in Table 5, our
method consistently performs well across different
settings.
• The CSI300 dataset is split chronologically
into training (2011/01/01-2019/12/31), val-
idation (2020/01/01-2020/12/31), and test
(2021/01/01-2024/12/01) periods.
• The CSI500 dataset is split chronologically
into training (2011/01/01-2019/12/31), val-
idation (2020/01/01-2020/12/31), and test
(2021/01/01-2024/12/01) periods.
• The S&P500 dataset is split chronologically
into training (2007/01/01-2014/12/31), val-
idation (2015/01/01-2015/12/31), and test
(2016/01/01-2020/12/01) periods.
• The HSI dataset is split chronologically
into training (2011/01/01-2019/12/31), val-
idation (2020/01/01-2020/12/31), and test
(2021/01/01-2025/12/01) periods.

C Prompt Design
C.1 Seven-Level Agent Hierarchy
Seven-Level Agent Hierarchy – Base Agent
You are a senior quantitative factor engi-
neer. Below is the schema of the input
DataFrame and a list of{columns_num}
existing factors:
{columns_desc}
The input DataFrame consists ofdaily ag-
gregated factors— i.e., each row repre-
sents a single trading day’s features for a
given stock, already aggregated to daily fre-
quency.
Please generate{num_per_request}new
and original quantitative factor functions
that are distinct from the existing ones.
Each factor should be implemented as a
complete Python function.

### Analysis of Effective Factors and
Innovation Directions:
Below is a condensed CoT-style summary
built from recent successful cases, explain-
ing why they work well.
Mini-Chain from Survivors (Observation
→Cause→Fix):
{effective_CoT}
Based on these strengths, focus on incor-
porating similar principles in new factor
creation. Seek innovative methods to gen-
erate more efficient, robust, and adapt-
able factors, ensuring they work well in
diverse market conditions while avoiding
look-ahead/leakage and redundancy.
—
### Analysis of Ineffective Factors and
Innovation Directions:
Below is a condensed CoT-style summary
built from recent failure cases, explaining
why they fail.
Mini-Chain from Failures (Observation →
Cause→Fix):
{ineffective_CoT}
Based on these failures, focus on avoiding
similar issues in new factor creation. Seek
innovative methods to generate more effec-
tive, robust, and adaptable factors, ensuring
they work well in diverse market conditions.
—
### Requirements:
- The input ‘DataFrame‘ has a MultiIndex of
(date, ticker), and has already been grouped
by ticker:
• Each input ‘DataFrame‘ is a time se-
ries of a single stock.
- Output: A ‘pd.Series‘ indexed by ‘(date,
ticker)‘ with thesame nameas the function.
- Each function must:
• Have a descriptive, unique name:
factor_<logic>_<transformation(s)>
_<window(s)>_<field>.
• Include a clear docstring explaining
the logic and formula.
• Balance predictive power with eco-
nomic/financial interpretability.
• Use an output column name that ex-
actly matches the function name.
• Be concise, precise, and readable.
• Build new alpha factors based on ex-
isting ones.
—
### Factor Design Guidance:
You are encouraged to explore a wide va-
riety of signals and techniques related to
{factor_type}, including but not limited to:
• List of common techniques / example
categories
• List of possible interactions or ad-
vanced ideas
Please do NOT limit yourself to simple for-
mulas or common patterns. You are ex-
pected to innovate, introduce mathemati-
cally sophisticated or unconventional struc-
tures, and combine multiple concepts where
reasonable.

## PDF page 22

The goal is to generate factors that arepre-
dictive,robust, andeconomically inter-
pretable, while beingstructurally diverse
from existing factors.

### Pre-imported libraries you can use
(current versions):
•"np" : import numpy as np (numpy
version: 2.2.6)
•"pd" : import pandas as pd(pandas
version: 2.2.3)
•"stats" : from scipy import stats
(scipy version: 1.15.3)
•"talib" : import talib (talib ver-
sion: 0.5.1)
•"math" : import math (built-in mod-
ule)
Coding Guidelines:
• Ensure the code is robust, efficient, and
optimized:
– Handle edge cases and exceptions
(e.g., NaN values).
– Minimize unnecessary computa-
tions and prefer vectorized opera-
tions (e.g., pandas, numpy).
–Ensure numerical stability.
– Strict Rule: Nested loops are
absolutely forbidden.
* You mustneverwrite any
form of loop inside another
loop.
* Forbidden patterns include
but are not limited to:
·forinsidefor
·whileinsidewhile
·forinsidewhile
·whileinsidefor
* Any nested iteration structure
isprohibited, regardless of
indentation depth.
* The use of while True or
any potentially infinite loop
isstrictly prohibited.
• When filtering or assigning val-
ues in a DataFrame, always
use df_copy.loc[row_indexer,
col_indexer] = value.
• Code should be clean, maintainable,
and efficient for large datasets:
– Use descriptive variable names
and minimize memory usage.
– Avoid creating unnecessary
copies of large DataFrames.
—
### Output format specification:
• Do NOT use markdown (like
“‘python).
• Do NOT add any explanation or com-
ments outside the function.
• Each function must be wrapped inside:
«function N»...«/function N».
• All generated code must be executable
and numerically stable.
• Always define intermediate columns
(e.g.,df_copy[’x’]) before referenc-
ing them later.
• The returned Seriesmustbe named
exactly the same as the function name.
• Each function should follow this for-
mat:
1<<function N>>
2def factor_xyz(df):
3"""Explain the logic. One
clear idea. Short
formula. No redundant
stacking."""
4df_copy = df.copy()
5# factor computation
6return df_copy["factor_xyz
"]
7<</function N>>

existing **daily-level factors**:
{columns_desc}
Please generate **{num_per_request}new
and original bar-shape-based alpha factor
functions** to forecast **10-day forward
returns**.
Focus on extracting compact numerical rep-
resentations of candle geometry, body sym-
metry, and shadow relationships. Avoid sim-
ple pattern labeling; design continuous and
interpretable shape metrics.
—
### Analysis of Effective Factors and In-
novation Directions:
Same as the Base Agent.
—
### Analysis of Ineffective Factors and
Innovation Directions:
Same as the Base Agent.
—
### Requirements:
Same as the Base Agent.
—
### Factor Design Guidance:
Translate candle geometry into quantitative
signals:
• ratios: (close-open)/(high-low), (high-
close)/(close-low), etc.;
• shadow asymmetry or balance indica-
tors;
• body-to-range normalization and per-
sistence over recent days;
• rolling geometry stability or asymme-
try;
• short-run shape momentum: recent
trend in candle proportions.
Encourage creativity and interpretability:
derive smooth, bounded, differentiable func-

Multi-Agent Quality Checker – Judger
You are an expert quantitative researcher
and alpha factor reviewer for a professional
factor research team.
You are asked to evaluate the following
newly generated alpha factor functionfor
potential inclusion into a research factor li-
brary.
Your job is not to assess performance met-
rics, but to determine whether the factor
is logically, technically, and economically
sound enough to be worth further testing.
Your evaluation should focus onPractical
Soundness, with a professional mindset:
1. Does the factor have anyfuture infor-
mation leakage?
2. Is the factor calculationcorrect and
internally consistent?
3. Is the factor logiceconomically in-
terpretable(even if exploratory or
novel)?
4. Does the factor avoid obviouserrors
(such as invalid operations, unpro-
tected division by zero, undefined re-
sults)?
5. Is the factorefficiently implemented
(avoids unnecessary loops, leverages
vectorized operations, and is suitable
for large-scale backtesting)?
6. Does the factor strictlyavoid any
nested loops or potentially infinite
loops?
• Nested loops areforbiddenat
any depth:
–forinsidefor
–whileinsidewhile
–forinsidewhile
–whileinsidefor
• The use of while True or any
loop that can run indefinitely is
prohibited.

### Factor under review:
«function»
{code}
«/function»
The input DataFrame has a MultiIndex of
(date, ticker), grouped by ticker (i.e., a time
series per stock). Each input DataFrame is
a time series of a single stock. The func-
tion outputs a pd.Series indexed by (date,
ticker), with the same name as the function.
IMPORTANT: The input DataFrame is
sortedin chronological order, from the
earliest date at the top to the most recent
date at the bottom. This is critical for evalu-
ating time series-based factors and avoiding
information leakage.
—
### Evaluation Guidelines:
• Youmust rejectfactors with any form
offuture information leakage– this
is a critical error.
• You should reject factors that havelog-
ical errors,data issues, orimplemen-
tation mistakes.
• Pay special attention to operations like
rolling means, groupby transforms,
shifting, or reversing time series: en-
sure these only use past and present
data relative to each row, never future
data.
• Be mindful of efficiency: avoid factors
that are unnecessarily slow (e.g., un-
necessary loops, non-vectorized oper-
ations) – the factor should be suitable
for large-scale backtesting on millions
of records.
11742

## PDF page 29

• Beopen-minded: even unconven-
tional factor ideas may be worth ex-
ploring.
• Provide clear, specific and action-
able feedback if improvements can be
made.
• Anyfororwhileloop inside another
for or while loop isstrictly prohib-
ited, as it indicates poor scalability and
inefficiency for large cross-sectional
datasets.
• Never use constructs likewhile True
or any loop that lacks a clear and finite
termination condition.

tions (e.g., pandas, numpy).
–Ensure numerical stability.
• Strict Rule: Nested loops are abso-
lutely forbidden.
– You mustneverwrite any form
of loop inside another loop.
– Forbidden patterns include but
are not limited to:
* forinsidefor
* whileinsidewhile
* forinsidewhile
* whileinsidefor
– Any nested iteration structure is
prohibited, regardless of indenta-
tion depth.
– The use of while True or any
potentially infinite loop isstrictly
prohibited.
• Code should be clean, maintainable,
and efficient for large datasets:
– Use descriptive variable names
and minimize memory usage.
– Avoid creating unnecessary
copies of large dataframes.

### Output format specification:
• Candidates should strictly comply with
the Hard Complexity Constraints.
• Before generating the code, provide
detailed instructions on how to fix the
issues raised.
• Do NOT use markdown (like
“‘python).
• Do NOT add any explanation or com-
ments outside the function.
• Each function must be wrapped inside:
«function N»...«/function N».
• All generated code must be executable
and numerically stable.
• Always define intermediate columns
(e.g.,df_copy[’x’]) before referenc-
ing them later.
• The returned Seriesmustbe named
exactly the same as the function name.
• Each function should follow this for-
mat:
1<<function N>>
2def factor_xyz(df):
3"""Explain the logic. One
clear idea. Short
formula. No redundant
stacking."""
4df_copy = df.copy()
5# factor computation
6return df_copy["factor_xyz
"]
7<</function N>>
